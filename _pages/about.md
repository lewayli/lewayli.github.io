Hi! I am a PhD student of computer science at the Peking University. My research interests include repository-level code generation and grammatical error correction.

In the admission year of 2022, I entered the Computational Linguistics Lab in the Peking University as a Master Student. And my research field was Grammatical Error Correction. I have 2 papers (ACL 2024; NAACL 2025) in this field.

In the 2024, I applied for changing the target from Master's degree to the PhD degree. And my main research field changes to Code Generation under repository scenario. I have published FEA-Bench (ACL 2025) and for now I am conducting research on post-training of LLMs for repository-level code development. 

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in the code generation of LLMs. Welcome any collabrations.
