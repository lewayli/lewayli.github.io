Hi! I am a PhD student of computer science at the Peking University. My research interests include repository-level code generation and grammatical error correction.

In the admission year of 2022, I entered the Computational Linguistics Lab in the Peking University as a Master Student. And my research field was Grammatical Error Correction. I have 2 papers (ACL 2024; NAACL 2025) in this field.

In the 2024, I applied for changing the target from Master's degree to the PhD degree. And my main research field changes to Code Generation under repository scenario. I have published FEA-Bench (ACL 2025) and for now I am conducting research on post-training of LLMs for repository-level code development. 

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in the code generation of LLMs. Welcome any collabrations.


I am interested in linguistics and languages. For now, except English and Chinese, my Japnanese (N2) and Korean (TOPIK-5) is above medium-level. I also have experience in learning Fran√ßais, Deutsch, Portugues, Italian, Arab, Russian languages.

In my daily life, sports and photography are also my hobbies. I mainly play tennis, and is around 3.0 level. If you live around Peking University, welcome to make an appointment for tennis, squash, badminton, and so on.
